# Giphy API Key Configuration
# 
# To set up your Giphy API key:
# 1. Get a free API key from https://developers.giphy.com/
# 2. Copy this file to api_keys.properties (without .example)
# 3. Replace YOUR_GIPHY_API_KEY_HERE with your actual API key
#
# Note: The app will work with a demo key if this file is not configured,
# but using your own key is recommended for better rate limits.

GIPHY_API_KEY=YOUR_GIPHY_API_KEY_HERE
